a simple web application for task management with the ability to group by due date (Today, Tomorrow, Next 7 days). 
The user can view the list of tasks, open task details, edit properties, and save changes. All changes are automatically saved in the browser using localStorage.
Each task includes the following fields: title (header), description, category, status, priority, and due date. Tasks can be created, updated, or deleted.
The interface is made using the Ant Design component library and is adapted to different screen sizes.

The project uses React 18, TypeScript, React Router v6, Zustand for state management, and Vite for fast development and build.
